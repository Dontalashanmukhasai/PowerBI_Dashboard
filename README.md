🚗🔋 EV Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data using Python (EDA, cleaning, analysis) and Power BI (interactive dashboard). The goal is to uncover insights into adoption trends, regional distribution, and sales patterns to better understand the growth of the EV sector.

📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Dataset: Raw Dataset collected from the kaggle website
Format: CSV/Excel

2. Data Cleaning (Python)
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Standardized column names & formats
Converted data types for accurate analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Distribution of EV sales over years
State/region-wise adoption trends
Vehicle category breakdown (2W, 3W, 4W, etc.)
Correlation between variables
Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn


4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to make insights easy to explore:
📊 Year-wise EV sales trends
🌍 State-wise sales distribution (map view)
🚘 Vehicle type/category breakdown
📈 Comparative growth analysis

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, visualization

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Key Insights
Increasing adoption trend in EV sales over the years
Certain states show significantly higher adoption rates
Two-wheelers dominate EV sales, but 4W segment is growing
Seasonal or year-wise spikes in EV adoption

📌 How to Use

Clone the repository:
 git clone <repo-link>
Open Ev_Sales_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter to explore the data cleaning & EDA.
